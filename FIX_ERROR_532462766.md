# Fix for Error -532462766 (0xE0434352)

## 🎯 Error Identified

**Error Code**: -532462766 (0xE0434352)  
**Meaning**: .NET CLR Exception - Missing Windows App Runtime

This is a **known issue** with WinUI 3 applications. Your app is perfectly fine, it just needs the Windows App Runtime installed.

---

## ✅ THE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Windows App Runtime

**Download from Microsoft**:
https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.5/latest/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe

**Direct link**:
https://aka.ms/windowsappruntimeinstall-1.5-x64

**What to do**:
1. Click the link above
2. Download the installer
3. Run it (just double-click)
4. Accept the prompt
5. Wait for "Installation successful"

**That's it!** Then try running easyWSL.exe again.

---

## 🔍 Why This Happens

WinUI 3 applications (like easyWSL) require the **Windows App Runtime** to be installed separately.

It's like having a .NET app but not having .NET installed - the app is fine, but the system can't run it without the runtime.

---

## ✨ Alternative Installation Methods

### Method 1: Via PowerShell (Automatic)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
# Paste this command:

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://aka.ms/windowsappruntimeinstall-1.5-x64" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\windowsapp.exe"
Start-Process "$env:TEMP\windowsapp.exe" -Wait
Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\windowsapp.exe"
```

### Method 2: Via winget (if you have it)

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime.1.5
```

### Method 3: Repair if already installed

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime* | ForEach {
    Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Verify Installation

After installing, verify it worked:

```powershell
# Check if Windows App Runtime is installed
Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime*

# Should show something like:
# Name: Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime.1.5
# Version: 1.5.240311000.0
```
